hi

An R package that uses the babynames dataset to help users choose new names using criteria having to do with the letters in the name (e.g., a beginning letter) and/or a year the name was used in the United States at least five times. More name sets to be added!
<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  out.width = "100%"
)
```

The goal of regexcite is to ...
## Purpose

## Target


## Installation

You can install the development version of regexcite like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(regexcite)
## basic example code
new_name <- function(x, y) {
  set.seed(12345) #set random seed
  target_a ="^" #to be combined with target_n on line 58 in target_x
  target_n = substr(x, 1, 1) #targets first character of input name
  target_x = paste(target_a, target_n, sep = "") #combines ^ and first letter target, for use in line 58
  target_y = y #year. Need a check for this to be between 1880-2021 inclusive
  names <- babynames
  names_smaller <- names[c(1,3)] #new dataframe of years and names only
  names_year <- names_smaller |>
    filter(year == target_y) #filter names_smaller by the target year
  target <- names_year |>
    filter(str_detect(name, target_x)) 
#fiter target year dataframe by rows with names that start with the target character aka target_n (as formatte din target_y)
  target_rand <- target[sample(1:nrow(target), 3),]
  target_ret = list(target_rand$name)
  return(target_ret)
}
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
